Explain why this structure is illegal:
	struct Point {
	    int x;
	    int y;
	    struct Point p;
	};
This is illegal because the 'stuct Point p' command will continue to loop and attempt to allocate int x and int y, impossible as it will never know the size so it cannot allocate the structure.

a good hash funcion is one that will distribute evenly so that there are not a large amount of link lists, the hash map is like a pointer to a series of linked-lists.

Stacks, Queue, Hash, linked-list
