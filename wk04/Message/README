To compile the programs:

gcc -o create create.c -lrt
gcc -o send send.c -lrt
gcc -o receive receive.c -lrt

The executable 'create' is run first to create the message-parsing queue
The queue must have a name, and the name must begin with a slash.

The 'send' executable writes messages to the queue.

The 'receive' executable reads messages from the queue.
